# Movie-Recommendation-System

Dataset Link - https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

Amongst the files available in the .zip file, only two of them are required for this project, namely "movies.csv" and "ratings.csv".

I have used a Collaborative Filtering approach to implement this project.

Check out the ppt for detailed information about recommendation systems in general and about the algorithm and metric used.
